<p align="center"><strong>Milestone 1 project - Full Stack Web Developer course - Code Institute</strong></p>

This website will work as the invitation and information page for a wedding. The point of having a website such as this instead of a classic letter invitation is for the guests/users to have easy access to all the info they need and to be able to RSVP directly via a form. It is also a much better way for the couple getting married to keep track on RSVP's as well as other requests that might come in.

## UX

### User Stories

See below user stories:

> *- "As a guest, I expect to find all the practical information I need, so I can prepare for the wedding"*

> *- "As a guest, I expect that I will be able to smoothly RSVP to the invitation, so that I do not have to send it by letter or email"*

> *- "As a guest, I expect to find more information about the couple who are getting married, so I can learn more about them"*

> *- "As a guest, I expect to find contact information or social links to the couple, so I can contact them with questions"*

> *- "As a guest, I expect to find direct links to the venues, so I can check them out before the wedding"*

> *- "As a guest, I expect to find instructions on how to get to the venue, so I can plan for the trip"*

> *- "As a guest, I expect to find a schedule of the day with times, so I can get the idea of how long the event will be"*

### Strategy

The main goal for this website is for it to act as an invitation and information hub for the guests of the wedding, where they can see all details as well as RSVP directly in an effortless manner. They will also get the social links to the couple in order to smoothly contact them if needed. The website will be displayed in a user friendly, minimal and beautifully designed way. The website will also help the couple in their planning in the sense that they will be able to digitally receive RSVP's, as well as focus the contact flow to the certain social links that is provided on the website.

Project goals: 

- Design a beautiful and elegant welcoming website fitting for a wedding
- Have all relevant information available in a user friendly environment for the users
- Have a page with some extra "fun-to-know" information about the couple
- Have a RSVP page which is simple to navigate for any user

### Scope

The features of this website will let the users:

- Find all the details they need for the wedding about the location, directions and schedule 
- RSVP directly via the website through a form with options to add additional info 
- Get access to specific contact information they can use for questions about the wedding


### Structure

I wanted to focus mainly on the simplicity and elegance of a wedding website. Therefore ending up with a minimal structure which have the pages "Home", "The Couple", "The Details" as well as "RSVP". These pages will be easy to navigate through via the navbar.

### Skeleton

[Wireframe](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS1-wedding-website/blob/a019ce35133a506a45443ff541ea1d9b643e79aa/assets/docs/ms1-wireframe.pdf)

4 pages included in the wireframe which are:
- Home
- The Couple
- The Details
- RSVP

### Surface

#### Main inspiration

My main inspiration of the looks of the website is cherry blossoms in Japan. The reason for this is because the actual wedding will take part in Japan and it is usually a familiar sight for both non-Japanese and Japanese guests. 

#### Fonts

I have decided to go with a combination of the fonts **Libre Franklin** and **Parisienne**. The reason for choosing this style of combination is because I got inspired by several wedding websites I took inspiration from, it seems to be a common trait to mix a elegant font with a minimal font.

![Parisienne](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS1-wedding-website/blob/master/assets/img/parisienne.png?raw=true "Parisienne font")

**Parisienne** - A more elegant font fitting for a wedding, this is used on titles on top of pages and sections of a page. The reason for not using this throughout the website is because it is difficult to read in smaller font sizes.

![Libre Franklin](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS1-wedding-website/blob/master/assets/img/libre-franklin.png?raw=true "Libre Franklin font")

**Libre Franklin** - Acts as the font that cuts off from the elegant title and showing the information on the website in a clear an minimal matter. This font is used in descriptions and details of the website.

#### Colors

I have decided to go with the color palette below which focus on pastel pink, off white and gray. This matches the elegance of the wedding theme, as well as the cherry blossom and Japan inspiration the website has.

Color codes in same order as on the color palette image below:

- #f6f6f6 
- #ffe2e2
- #ffc7c7
- #aaaaaa

### Bugs

| Bug | Solution | Current status |
| --- | -------- | -------------- |
| White space stuck on bottom after footer on all devices | Made background image cover whole page | Solved |
| Empty space to the right on index.html and rsvp.html which makes content look un-centered when on mobile or scrolling to the right on desktop | **index.html**: Removed left 50% position of vertical line, which made it push the page width and gave a space to the right. Found through inspect chrome. **rsvp.html**: Removed margin left and right from .row. It made so the screen width was over 100%, therefore making a space to the right. Found through inspect chrome. | Solved |

### Browser and screen size responsiveness

Have done extensive testing in Chrome DevTools, different browsers as well as on physical devices I had access to. The website is responsive and it acts as it is supposed to when changing between devices, browsers and screen sizes.

| Bad value button for attribute type on element a: Subtype missing. | Removed type="button"|
| The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. | Removed frameborder as it was 0 and not needed |

All errors and warnings are now gone.
